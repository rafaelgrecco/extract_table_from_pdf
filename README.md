# **Extract Tables from Pdf Files**
This application emerged from the studies of the *pdfplumber* library. Its operation is extremely simple and is very useful to help people who deal daily with pdf files and need to extract tables from these files in their work, college or other activity. Improvement modifications are welcome, it's still in its first version, so it might malfunction with some files.

For use, see the model, available in the test folder, ensure that your pdf file is in this way. The model used to build the application can be found on the official github of the [pdfplumber library](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber).

## **Using the application**
To use it is extremely simple, just write the following line of code in the folder that contains the main.py file:

`python3 main.py --path *`

Where * represents the directory where the pdf file is stored
